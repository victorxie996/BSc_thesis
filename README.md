# Solution Methods for Optimal Power Flow
Optimal Power Flow problems aim to minimize the power generating cost while satisfying network constraints. Here we develop our own Sequential Linear Programming and Sequential Quadratic Programming solvers from first principles in MATLAB. We use a MATLAB-AMPL interface to obtain the AC OPF model data from AMPL. These solvers will aim to converge to optimal solutions for different sized Optimal Power Flow problems. We find SQP to be more reliable than SLP. However SLP converges faster for cases where it obtains a solution. We conclude that the solutions provided by the SLP solver are not optimal and our SQP solver only finds optimal solutions for two cases. We suggest further alterations to the algorithms we have written to improve optimality of the solutions.
